# Bowles Farming Website Backup (as of 7/1/2019)

# Important Notice
This project is no longer actively under development, as the Innovate To Grow final submission date has passed; however, Kyran has migrated the website (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.), Python script, and CSV files in its current form to another Github repository and website.

(I lied, this is the last commit to this repository, also it was actively under development until 6/23/2019, but now it's definitely discontinued.)

Also this is a backup just in case Emery@Bowles decides to take down the Github account hosting the website. I want to have a copy of my work just in case.
