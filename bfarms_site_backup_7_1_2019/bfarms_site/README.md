## Project Details
Taken from the [UC Merced Innovate to Grow website](https://innovatetogrow.ucmerced.edu/project-submissions/2019-01-spring-cse):
### Background
Bowles Farming Company is a sixth generation family farm out of Los Banos, CA. Bowles continuously strives to implement new technology to improve processes and activities around the farm.
### Problem
AgWorld is a modern farm management program that allows operations to plan and track jobs and costs associated in one program. We will be using AgWorld for task assignment and data collection. AgWorld has a very robust API which allows programs to extract as much information as needed about jobs in the database. Although a large amount of data is logged in AgWorld, it is not presented as well as it could be.
### Objectives
A step toward making AgWorld data presentable is to have a dashboard showing upcoming and completed jobs while highlighting overdue jobs. This data would be presented on TVs or as web platforms for users around the farm to get updated about what is going on and what has happened. This communication tool will help get everyone on the same page about what operations has done and what's coming up.
