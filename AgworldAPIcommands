attributes[completed_at] 	Timestamp when the activity was completed.

attributes[started_at] 	Timestamp when an activity was started.

attributes[updated_at] 	Timestamp of the last activity update.


attributes[due_at] 	Date that the activity is due.

id 	Unique ID of the activity.





we should be comparing the [completed_at] and [due_at] as those are the two comparisons that are the most important for task status

This is psudeo code for basically how the API comparisons should be done
The API data is compared and that comparison sets a task staus
	This task status should be taken and then updated for field by 		editing the csv

if(completed_at < due_at)
	for (id)
	task status = complete

else if (completed_at + 24hrs > due_at)
	for (id)
	task status = late

else (completed_at > due_at)
	for (id)
	task staus = behind
